    <h1><font color = "green"><b>VSCODE</b> as Offline editor</font></h1>
    <p style = "color: rgb(206, 66, 136);"> Visual Studio Code provides basic support for HTML programming out of the box.
         <b><font color = "yellow">There is syntax highlighting</font></b>, smart completions with IntelliSense, and customizable formatting.
          VS Code also includes great Emmet support.
          You can also work with embedded CSS and JavaScript. However, note that script and style includes from other files are not followed, 
          the language support only looks at the content of the <i>HTML</i> file.
